                <p>The $34,000 instrument is the newest addition to the <a href="index.html">Barrier Reef Orchestra's</a> repertoire, and Leah says it's a privilege each time she gets to play it.</p>
                <p>"It is a beautiful harp," she said</p>
                <p>"It has a very very beautiful sound."</p>
                <p>The harp weighs 30 kilograms and has 47 strings. Leah likens the strings to the white keys on a piano, while the pedals are the black keys.</p>
                <p>At home Leah practices on a much older harp, but she says it gets the job done.</p>
                <p>"I have [had] an old harp for about 15 years now, the sound is really good but mechanically you just need to tune up," she said.</p>
                <p>"You actually need to tune the harp mechanically because there's so many different pins and so many pedals... [it's] a lot of work to maintain it."</p>
                <p>Orchestra president Andrew Ryder says the harp is a great addition to the ensemble; previously they had to hire a harp and fly a harpist up especially for their performances.</p>
                <p>Luckily Leah had just moved to Townsville when the Orchestra purchased the harp.</p>
                <p>"It's a wonderful instrument visually but of course the sound of the harp is just fantastic live," Andrew said. </p>
                <p>"It's immediately identifiable and it adds so much to the orchestra. </p>
                <p>"We wish it would come with a truck as well to move it around," he added. </p>
                <p>The <a href="index.html">Barrier Reef Orchestra's</a> first performance for the year is on this Sunday, March 29 at the Townsville Civic Theatre, and will feature Leah on the harp and flute player Jennifer Bradstreet.</p>
