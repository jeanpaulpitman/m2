Milestone 2 – Finished Site –30%
Due: Week 13, Friday 26 May

This is the finished product website, the result of your team going through the complete design and development process. Assessment of this milestone is for both completeness and quality.
Complete the provided report file called report.html, which must contain brief dot-point details for:
•	a link to the GitHub repo where you stored and collaborated on this project - this allows the lecturer to view the progress/history of your development work and see who made which commits at what times
•	the work that you have completed and any details required to test the site, including usernames, passwords, instructions if needed, outstanding issues
•	references for any code, images or content that you have used that is not your own
•	PMI - your group should spend some time reflecting on the process and describe here the Pluses, Minuses and Interesting aspects of your teamwork process and result
Please note that it is acceptable to find and use code for parts of your site. You must write the core functionality yourself. You cannot use any existing content management systems or existing templates. The work you submit must be substantially your own, but using existing libraries to achieve parts of it is actually good practice and is recommended. In particular, you are welcome to use existing JavaScript libraries and example code for adding interest and functionality. 
Please ask on the LearnJCU discussion board or Facebook group if you are unsure about what is considered acceptable. 
You must reference any code that you use that you did not create in your report.html file.
