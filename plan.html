</section>
<section>
	<h1>Success Evaluation</h1>
	<p>Success evaluation will be measured as a direct increase in online membership sales, and Orchestra attendance numbers. Currently, Orchestra ticket sales are outsourced to Ticketshop with Barrier Reef Orchestra receiving a share of the ticket sales for each performance. Whereas, Membership sales is handled inhouse from the current website.</p>
	<p>Both Membership sales, and Orchestra attendance revenue streams allow quantifiable measurements to track revenue increase. It is expected the Goal of a combined 50% revenue increase be reached within twelve months for the website to be deemed successful.</p>

	<h1>Target Audience</h1>
	<h3>Who</h3>
	<p>Historically, the Barrier Reef Orchestra has attracted music lovers from many of Townsville’s social groups:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Music Teachers, seeking to hone and display their skills.</li>
		<li>Defense Families, often linked to the military band.</li>

		<li>Lawyers and other Professionals, seeking to engage in cultural philanthropy.</li>
		<li>High School Students, eager to play at the next level.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>In addition to local talent, The Barrier Reef Orchestra regularly attracts Guest Conductors and Artists keen to play with the Orchestra. Guest Artists can be located both domestically and internationally creating a potentially global audience for the website.</p>
	<p>Barrier Reef Orchestra has identified the current member base to be 13-73. However, Barrier Reef Orchestra want to attract a younger target audience as follows:</p>
	<h4>Target Audience, 13-40-year old’s.</h4>

		<li>Music lovers, concert lovers.</li>

	<h3>How</h3>
	<p>We make it Spunky! The Great Barrier Reef will feature as a key design element and palette reference. Having the reef on our doorstep is a truly stunning attraction for domestic and international visitors alike, so let’s remind them of the Orchestras namesake. Furthermore, the Barrier Reef Orchestra is a prestigious ensemble, our design aims to maintain a prestigious feel and look that the educated, sophisticated, and cultured target audience expects.</p>
	<p> And most importantly, our target audience is likely to visit the website on both traditional PC and mobile devices, creating a responsive design will ensure the best customer experience on any device.</p>
